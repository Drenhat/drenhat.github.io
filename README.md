# Portfolio
> This is my very first portfolio

## Description
> This project is an MIT Xpro assignement. We were to connect different projects from our github using the framework Bootstrap. Instead of simply adding the required information, I designed the website as well as I could, implementing new fonts, icons, etc. The framework was very useful to modify the grid, but I had to modify the css for it to meet my expectations.

## How to run
> The website launches on the home page. You can see the project pages through the nav bar, or by clicking on the project icon on the home page. The nav bar also lead the user to an "about me" and a contact section.

## Roadmap of future improvements
> This website needs to be more responsive.

## Contacts
> For future projects, you can follow me or contact me through my portfolio: https://drenhat.github.io/

## License information
> The code is an improvement from an MIT xPro exercise. I have also used the framework Bootstrap.
